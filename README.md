there're two files dm.py and first.py, which both are the linkedin bot, as name suggest Dm.py will help you to send a customizeable DM to your connections and First.py will help you to comment on poeple's post over your linkedin.
You can use both and don't forget to read that code first, because you have yo put your email and password of your linkedin
